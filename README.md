# Verilog-code-for-the-multiplier
This project is to implement a 4x4 multiplier using Verilog HDL. Full Verilog code for the multiplier is presented.  The technique being used is shift/add algorithm, but the different feature is using a two-phase self-clocking system in order to reduce the multiplying time by half.
